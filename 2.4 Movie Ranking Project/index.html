<h1>My Coding story</h1>

<h4>written by Daniel Jackson on 1/5/2023</h4></p>

<p>I started coding after a achieved success with my AWS cloud practitioner study, when i finished this study,
    I realisd that i have the capacity to achieve any thing.</p>

<p>The story is that i have tried to code several times, but it failed, but the AWS helped me realize another
aspect of me that i never knew. </p>

<p>on the 23 of novemeber, i started the journey, and since then its been forward ever. 
i have completed mypython coding from day1 to day 40 on this 100 days of code.</p>

<p>What i have learnt is to know that there is nothing impossible if we can do the work.
</p>
<h3>I will see you in my success.</h3>
